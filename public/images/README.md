# Adding Your ChumpFun Logo

To add your ChumpFun logo to the countdown page:

1. **Save your logo file** as `chumpfun-logo.png` in this folder (`public/images/`)
2. **Recommended logo specifications:**
   - Format: PNG (with transparency) or JPG
   - Size: 200x120 pixels (or similar aspect ratio)
   - Background: Transparent or black (will look best)
   - Style: Should work well on a black background

3. **Alternative formats supported:**
   - You can also use `chumpfun-logo.jpg`, `chumpfun-logo.svg`, etc.
   - Just update the filename in `pages/index.tsx` if needed

4. **If no logo is found:**
   - A placeholder will automatically show with "CHUMPFUN LOGO HERE"
   - This helps you see the layout while you prepare your logo

The logo will automatically scale to fit the design and have a subtle glow effect!
